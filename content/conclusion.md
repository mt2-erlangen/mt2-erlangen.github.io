# 6. Outlook and Conclusion
You have now built all the tools needed to use the final provided plugin called `User_Interface`. 
It allows you to play around with the different kinds of image-processing-techniques, you learned to apply over the course of this project.

In subsequent steps, segmentation can be for example be applied to facilitate or automate the diagnosis for the radiologist.
There is great research interest in segmentation, edge detection, and various similar processing methods.

* Name at least two examples of current trends in image processing. Provide citations for each example and describe them briefly.
* For your examples, are they already applied to clinical routine? If not, do you think they soon will be? Try to explain why or why not.

In the last part, summarize what you have implemented and explained in your project report. Review the shortcomings of your approaches and how they could be mitigated in the future, and conclude your report.

## Submission 

Once you are finished with your code and satisfied with the results, please compress the entire `src` folder into a zip file and upload it to StudOn.
