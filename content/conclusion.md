# 6. Outlook and Conclusion
In this project, you learned Otsu's method and multiple edge detection algorithms.
Now you know the basic concepts of how to process and segment images.
In subsequent steps, segmentation can be for example be applied to facilitate or automate the diagnosis for the radiologist.
There is great research interest in segmentation, edge detection, and various similar processing methods.

* Name at least two examples of current trends in image processing. Provide citations for each example and describe them briefly.
* For your examples, are they already applied to clinical routine? If not, do you think they soon will be? Try to explain why or why not.

In the last part, summarize what you have implemented and explained in your project report. Review the shortcomings of your approaches and how they could be mitigated in the future, and conclude your report.
