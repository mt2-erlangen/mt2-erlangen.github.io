# Images and 2D Waves

In this exercise, we finally work with images. It's time to update the file `src/main/java/lme/DisplayUtils.java` [to the newest version](https://github.com/mt2-erlangen/exercises-ss2021/blob/master/src/main/java/lme/DisplayUtils.java).

This should provide you the following methods to work with images:

```java
    // Open a file
    public static mt.Image openImage(String path) 

    // Download and open a file from the internet
    public static mt.Image openImageFromInternet(String url, String filetype) 

    // Save an image to a file
    public static void saveImage(mt.Image image, String path) 

    //  Show images
    public static void showImage(float[] buffer, String title, int width) 
    public static void showImage(float[] buffer, String title, long width, float[] origin, double spacing, boolean replaceWindowWithSameName)
    
    // Calculate a Fourier transform for an image
    public  static void FFT(float[] buffer, String title, long width, float[] origin, double spacing)

```

# mt/Image.java

<P align="right"><i>4 Points</i>

*The code for this section should go to `src/main/java/mt/Image.java`*

Our goal is to share as much code with our `mt.Signal` class. So `mt.Image` will be a subclass of `mt.Signal`.

```java
// <your name> <your idm>
// <your partner's name> <your partner's idm> (if you submit with a group partner)
package mt;

import lme.DisplayUtils;

public class Image extends Signal {


}
```

`mt.Image` has five members (apart from the ones inherited by `mt.Signal`).

```java
    // Dimensions of the image
    protected int width; 
    protected int height; 

    // Same as Signal.minIndex but for X and Y dimension
    protected int minIndexX;
    protected int minIndexY;

    // For a later exercise (no need to do anything with it in exercise 3)
    protected float[] origin = new float[]{ 0, 0 };
```


And two constructors:

```java
    // Create an image with given dimensions
    public Image(int width, int height, String name)

    // Create an image with given dimensions and also provide the content
    public Image(int width, int height, String name, float[] pixels)
```

As shown in the exercise slides, we will store all the pixels in one array, like we did in `Signal`.
The array should have the size `width * height`.
`minIndexX`,`minIndexY` should be 0 for normal images.

![Constructor](../image_constructor.png)
<!--**TODO: Nice image here. With width and height and buffer_size=width * height**-->

Call the constructors of the super class `Signal` in the constructors of `Image`.
You can call the constructor of a super class by placing `super(...)` with the respetive arguments in the first line of the constructor of the subclass.
The constructor `public Image(int width, int height, String name, float[] pixels)` does not need to create its own array (take `pixels` for `buffer`).
But you can check whether `pixels` has the correct size.

Let's also provide some getters!

```java
    // Image dimensions
    public int width()
    public int height()

    // Minimum and maximum indices (should work like Signal.minIndex/maxIndex)
    public int minIndexX()
    public int minIndexY()
    public int maxIndexX()
    public int maxIndexY()
```

`atIndex` and `setAtIndex` should work like in `Signal` except that they now have two coordinate indices.
`atIndex` should return `0.0f` if either the `x` or `y` index are outside of the image ranges.

```java
    public float atIndex(int x, int y)
    public void setAtIndex(int x, int y, float value) 
    
    //We need a method to set our buffer for the show() function
    public void setBuffer(float[] buffer)
	
```

Remember how we calculated the indices in the exercise slides. You have to apply that formula in `atIndex`/`setAtIndex`.

![Constructor](../smile_extended.png)
<!--**TODO: Nice image here. With width and height and buffer_size=width * height**-->

Add the method `show` to display the image
```java
    public void show() {
        DisplayUtils.showImage(buffer, name, width(), origin, /*spacing()*/ 1.0f, /*Replace window with same name*/true);
    }
```


Open the image `pacemaker.png` in a file  `src/main/java/exercise/Exercise03`:

```java
// <your name> <your idm>
// <your partner's name> <your partner's idm> (if you submit with a group partner)
package exercises;

import mt.Image;

public class Exercise03 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        (new ij.ImageJ()).exitWhenQuitting(true);

        Image image = lme.DisplayUtils.openImageFromInternet("https://mt2-erlangen.github.io/pacemaker.png", ".png");
        image.show();

    }
}
```

The image is from [our open access book](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319965192).

![pacemaker.png](../pacemaker.png)

You can check the correctness of `atIndex` with the `ImageTest`in the file [src/test/java/ImageTests.java](https://github.com/mt2-erlangen/exercises-ss2021/blob/main/src/test/java/mt/ImageTests.java). 

# 2D Waves

<P align="right"><i>4 Points</i>

We implemented a 1D Sin and Cos function in `Exercise01`. Now we want to build the 2D functions in `SineWave2d` and `CosineWave2d`. Create the two files `src/main/java/mt/SineWave2d` and `src/main/java/mt/CosineWave2d`. They will be a subclass of `mt.Image`.

Additionally we are building a class `Vector2d`, which sets the frequency and orientation of our waves. Create therefore the file  `src/main/java/mt/Vector2d`.

The class has two members `k_x`and `k_y` and a simple constructor.

```java

package mt;

public class Vector2d {
    float kx,ky;

    public Vector2d(float kx, float ky){
        ...

    }
    
}    
```

To use the vector in the calculation of our Sine and Cosine waves, we need to implement a function `dot` to form the dot product of two vectors:

$$ a \cdot b = \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i b_i$$

```java
public float dot(Vector2d other)


```
The vector and the waves can be visualized like in the lecture:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jujbTM78pzo?start=1292" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The setup for the 2D wave functions will be the following:


```java

package mt;

public class SineWave2d extends Image {
    
}    
```
The `min` and `max` indices of the wave functions should be set to $-[\frac{Width}{2}]$, $[\frac{Width}{2}]$ and $-[\frac{Height}{2}]$, $[\frac{Height}{2}]$.

Both classes have a constructor in which you need set the pixel intensity in the buffer with the hep of the vector k:

```java
    public CosineWave2d(Vector2d k, int width, int height, String name)
    public SineWave2d(Vector2d k, int width, int height, String name)
    
```

To get the intensity of each pixel of the 2D Wave Image we can use the following formulas:

$$IntensityCos\left[x,y\right] = \cos\left((\frac{x}{Width}\cdot k_x+\frac{y}{Height}\cdot k_y) \cdot 2\pi\right) $$

$$IntensitySin\left[x,y\right] = \sin\left((\frac{x}{Width}\cdot k_x+\frac{y}{Height}\cdot k_y) \cdot 2\pi\right) $$

# Adding up waves and looking at the Fourier Transform
<P align="right"><i>2 Points</i>

To add up multiple signals we implement a similar methods like in `Exercise 1`.

```java
public Image add(Image image)
```

The method `add` should add up two images element wise. Return the addition with a new image. Be careful with the `min` and `max` indices of the images. Check if the images differ in size and throw an exception otherwise. <br>
Can you create an Image with checkerboard like patterns, by adding up multiple waves?

 <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../ResultAdd.tif" alt="ResultAdd.tif" width="256"/><p>
 
 Additionally we want to look at the Fourier transformation of our waves. As you saw in the lecture, the Fourier transform analysis the frequency spectrum of our signal. <br>
 Add the function `fft` to the `mt.image` class, which calls a function from `DisplayUtils.java`:
 
 ```java
    public void fft(){
        DisplayUtils.FFT(buffer, name, width(), origin, /*spacing()*/ 1.0f);
    }
```

The function can be called just like the `show()`function. Be careful with the image size. The FFT of imageJ works best for our signals with image sizes of $2^n$ ($64x64$,$256x256$,....). <br>
Can you tell to which wave functions these frequency spectrum belong?

 <p style="text-align: center;">
<table><tr>
<td> <img src="../FFTofCosine01.png" alt="FFTofCosine01.png"  style="width: 256;"/> </td>
<td> <img src="../FFTofCosine10.png" alt="FFTofCosine10.png" style="width: 256;"/> </td>
</tr></table>
 <p>

How does the Fourier transform of our first picture `pacemaker.png` look like?

<br>
<br>

In the end you can use the Demo below to test some behavior of 2D Sine and Cosine Waves with different and multiple $k_x , k_y$ parameters.
