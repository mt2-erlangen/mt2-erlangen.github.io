# Iterative Reconstruction

Using backprojection, we could achieve a blurry reconstruction result.
The Filtered Backprojection algorithm solves this problem by applying a filtering step before backprojection.
For the project work, we will take a different approach.

In the last section, you measured the error between your reconstruction and the ground truth volume.
However, this is only possible when doing a simulation and not when reconstructing an unknown real object.
What we can do instead is meassuring the error in the projection domain by simply projecting the reconstruction!
Implement the following method to use with our `reconstructionProjector`:

```java
    // In mt/Projector.java
    public void reconstructIteratively(Image meassuredProjection, int sliceIdx, int numIterations)
```

It should
- call `projectSlice` on `volume` to obtain a projection of our reconstruction
- calculate an error image subtracting `singogram.getSlice(sliceIdx)` from `meassuredProjection`
- replace the current slice of `singogram` by our error image
- call `backprojectSlice` with the current `sliceIdx`
- repeat all this for `numIterations` iterations

So we're now doing an reconstruction of the error and adding it to our blurry image.
Does this reduce our error?

Our reconstruction algorithm is now finished. But it only operates on 2-d slices.
Create 3-d versions of `projectSlice`, `backprojectSlice` and `reconstructIteratively`:
```java
    public void project()
    public void backproject()
    public void reconstructIteratively(Volume measuredProjections)
```
All they should do is calling their 2-d version for each slice.
You should now be able to reconstruct volumes.

*Hint: You can use the following construct instead of a for-loop to enable multi-threaded calculation.*

```java
    // You have to replace `var` by `java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger` when using Java 1.8
    var progress = new java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger(0);
    IntStream.range(0, sinogram.depth()).parallel().forEach(z -> {
        System.out.println("Progess: " + (int) (progress.incrementAndGet() * 100.0 / (double) sinogram.depth()) + " %");
        //Do stuff here for slice z
        ...
    };
```

## Project Report

For the project, describe how your iterative reconstruction algorithm works. You should not mention implementation details
like variable name or function names. Compare it with the Filtered Backprojection algorithm! It's not necessary to explain 
Filtered Backprojection Algorithm in detail. Just highlight the main difference.

Test your reconstruction algorithm on a slice of a CT reconstruction of the Cancer Imaging Archive.
Measure the error of the reconstructed slices after each iteration.
Include a figure showing this error in dependance of the iteration number in the project report.
Include images comparing ground truth, the backprojected slice and 

Comment on the error and the images in your text.
Does the result of the iterative reconstruction look better than solely using backprojection?

This part of the project report should be no longer than 1.5 pages.

# Conclusion

In the last part, summarize want you have implemented and explained in your project report.
Review the shortcommings of your simplified approach and how they could be mitigated in future.
Draw a conclusion on your work!

This part of the project work should be about a quarter page long and should contain no images.

# Submission

Submit until your project report as a PDF and your entire project folder until **August 09 23:55h**.
Your project must compile as a whole!
Make sure that you had a last look at our [checklist](../checklist).
