# 2D Convoultion and Image Filters

In this exercise, we are using our `Image` class from `exercise 3` to build a 2D convolution, which you already implemented for the 1D case in `exercise 2`. 


# mt.Image Filter

<P align="right"><i>4  Points</i>:


Analog in Exercise 2, we want to be able to convolve an image signal. In fact, we will learn multiple ways to process images.
Let's create an interface (`src/main/java/mt/ImageFilter.java`) as a template for the image filters to be implemented, so we only need to implement this once.

```java
package mt;

public interface ImageFilter {
    default mt.Image apply(mt.Image image) {
        Image output = new Image(image.width(), image.height(), image.name() + " processed with " + this.name());
        apply(image, output);
        return output;
    }

    default void apply(mt.Image input, mt.Image output) {
        throw new RuntimeException("Please implement this method!");
    }

    String name();
}
```

In application, an output image of same size as the input is often needed. This is implemented in the template. The default method `void apply` of the interface needs to be overwritten in the class definition further down.

Next, the image convolution. The class to be implemented will have a method `normalize` that we will need later. It uses a method `sum()`, which we need to implement in our `Signal` class. The method sums up all values of our signal:

```java
public float sum() //< sum of all signal values 
    
```

*The code for the convolution should go to `src/main/java/mt/LinearImageFilter.java`*


```java
// <your name> <your idm>
// <your partner's name> <your partner's idm> (if you submit with a group partner)
package mt;

public class LinearImageFilter extends Image implements ImageFilter {

    public void normalize() {
	double sum = sum();
	for (int i = 0; i < buffer.length; i++) {
	    buffer[i] /= sum;
	}
    }
}
```

Create a constructor for it. Recall how we implemented `LinearFilter`!
`minIndexX` and `minIndexY` need to be set to $-\lfloor L_x/2 \rfloor$ and $-\lfloor L_y/2 \rfloor$ when $L_x$ is the
filter's width and $L_y$ the filter's height.
```java
    public LinearImageFilter(int width, int height, String name)
```


Convolution in 2-d works similar to convolution in 1-d.<!-- [Compare with the formula from exercise 01](@/exercise_1.md#linearfilter-java)-->

 $$K_x = \lfloor L_x/2 \rfloor$$
 $$K_y = \lfloor L_y/2 \rfloor$$
 $$g[x,y] = \sum_{y'=-K_y}^{+K_y} \sum_{x'=-K_x}^{+K_x} f[x-x', y-y'] \cdot h[ x', y' ] $$
 $$g[x,y] = \sum_{y'=\text{h.minIndexY}}^{\text{h.maxIndexY}} \sum_{x'=\text{h.minIndexX}}^{\text{h.maxIndexX}} f[x-x', y-y'] \cdot h[ x', y' ] $$

 Remember to use `atIndex` and `setAtIndex` to get and set the values.
	
 Implement the convolution again in a method called `apply`.
 
```java
    public void apply(Image image, Image result)
```

<P align="right"><i>Source: https://github.com/vdumoulin/conv_arithmetic</i>

 The `Image` named `result` is an empty array that is (already) created by our interface `ImageFilter`. It will be initialized empty as defined in the interface in `default Image apply`, and will be filled with the result once the actual filter (futher below) is implemented and called.
	
It's time to test. We just need to add another method to our `Signal` class:

```java
// Needs: import java.util.Random
public void addNoise(float mean, float standardDeviation) {
Random rand = new Random();
for (int i = 0; i < buffer.length; i++) {
	   buffer[i] += mean + rand.nextGaussian() * standardDeviation;
	}
 }

```
Now you can use the file [`src/test/java/mt/LinearImageFilterTests.java`](https://www.studon.fau.de/studon/goto.php?target=fold_4553479).

## Gauss Filter

<P align="right"><i>2 Points</i>

*The code for the Gauss filter should go to `src/main/java/mt/GaussFilter2d.java`.*

Recap for a second here. Note: at this point your actual filter class (to be implemented, in this case for the Gauss filter) is a subclass of the class `LinearImageFilter` which is a subclass of class `Image` as well as of the interface `ImageFilter`. Map that out in your head (or on paper), and remember that all methods are inherited through the parent classes/interface. Recap end.
	
The Gauss filter is a `LinearImageFilter` with special coefficients (the filter has the same height and width).

```java
// <your name> <your idm>
// <your partner's name> <your partner's idm> (if you submit with a group partner)
package mt;

public class GaussFilter2d extends LinearImageFilter {
    
}
```

It has the following constructor

```java
    public GaussFilter2d(int filterSize, float sigma)
```

In the constructor, set the coefficients according to the unormalized 2-d normal distribution with standard deviation $\sigma$ (`sigma`).
`Math.exp` is the exponetial function.  Use `setAtIndex` to set:

$$ h[x,y] = \frac{1}{2 \pi \sigma^2}\mathrm{e}^{-\frac{x^2+y^2}{2 \sigma^2}}$$

where $x$ should run from `minIndexX` to `maxIndexX` and $y$ from `minIndexY` to `maxIndexY`.
Call `normalize()` at the end of the constructor to ensure that all coefficients sum up to one.

Test your Gauss filter in `Exercise04.java`.
Use arbitray values for `sigma` and `filterSize`.
The Gauss filter will blur your input image clearly if you chose a large value for sigma.

There is also a unit test file that you can use: [`src/test/java/mt/GaussFilter2dTests.java`](https://www.studon.fau.de/studon/goto.php?target=fold_4553479)

## More Filters!

<P align="right"><i>4 Points</i>

Lets try implement even more filters, to see in how many ways we can use our `LinearImageFilter` class!
<br>
<br>
*The code for the Average filter should go to `src/main/java/mt/Averagefilter2d.java`.*

The **Average filter** is a `LinearImageFilter` with special coefficients (the filter has the same height and width).

```java
// <your name> <your idm>
// <your partner's name> <your partner's idm> (if you submit with a group partner)
package mt;

public class AverageFilter2d extends LinearImageFilter {
    
}
```
It has the following constructor

```java
    public AverageFilter2d(int filterSize)
```

Use `setAtIndex`: $x$ should run from `minIndexX` to `maxIndexX` and $y$ from `minIndexY` to `maxIndexY`. This filter takes the average around its neighbours.

$$ h[x,y] = \frac{1}{filterSize*filterSize}$$


	
	
*The code for the Derivative filter should go to `src/main/java/mt/Derivativefilter2d.java`.*

The **Derivative filter** is a `LinearImageFilter` and has always a fixed size of $3$.

```java
// <your name> <your idm>
// <your partner's name> <your partner's idm> (if you submit with a group partner)
package mt;

public class DerivativeFilter2d extends LinearImageFilter {
    
}
```
It has the following constructor, which uses a boolean to termine its direction. The standart should be in x direction.

```java
    public DerivativeFilter2d(boolean transpose)
```
The filter computes the derivative of each point in either x or y direction.

$$ \partial x = [-1,0,1] , \partial y = [-1,0,1]^T$$

<br>
<br>
The last filter we implement is a sharpening filter.

	
	
*The code for the Sharpening filter should go to `src/main/java/mt/Sharpeningfilter2d.java`.*

The **Sharpening filter** is a `LinearImageFilter` with a kernel size of $3x3$.

```java
// <your name> <your idm>
// <your partner's name> <your partner's idm> (if you submit with a group partner)
package mt;

public class SharpeningFilter2d extends LinearImageFilter {
    
}
```
It has the following constructor

```java
    public SharpeningFilter2d(float focus)
```

Use `setAtIndex`: $x$ should run from `minIndexX` to `maxIndexX` and $y$ from `minIndexY` to `maxIndexY`. The filter takes the negative average of its neighbourhood and enhances its current position by the value of `focus`.

$$ h[x,y] = -\frac{(focus-1)}{8}$$
$$ h[0,0] = focus $$

My filter results look like this:

 <p style="text-align: center;">
<table><tr>
<td> <img src="../filtergauss.png" alt="filtergauss.png"  style="width: 256;"/> </td>
<td> <img src="../filterxd.png" alt="filterxd.png" style="width: 256;"/> </td>

</tr>
<tr>
<th>Gauss Filter</th> 
<th>Derivate Filter in x driection</th> 
<th>Derivate Filter in y driection</th> 
</tr>
<tr>
<td> <img src="../filteravg.png" alt="filteravg.png" style="width: 256;"/> </td>
<td> <img src="../filtersharp.png" alt="filtersharp.png" style="width: 256;"/> </td>
</tr>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Average Filter </th> 
<th>Sharpening Filter</th> 
</tr>
</table>

Can you reproduce them?
