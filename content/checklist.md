# General Information

The deadline for the project report is on April 3<sup>rd</sup>.\
The project report, as well as the coding, are individual work. As such, you need to submit them individually.
Note: we'll check for plagiarism.

# Guidelines

The project report can be written in either English or German. Please write between 4 and 6 pages of text, not counting the images.


We expect you to:

- Use the **LaTeX template** we provide
  - [LaTeX template link](https://github.com/mt2-erlangen/latex-template)
  - Do not modify the style or the formatting. No ornaments for page numbers!
  - The template defines the overall structure of your project. You have to fill in all the gaps.
  - Do not change the order of the sections in our template.
  - Do not change the titles of sections or subsections.
  - Do not change the order of the figures in the project. You can optionally add new figures to the report.


- Use **scientific references** in your explanations to clearly separate your work from the work of others:
  - Create a **bibliography**, using the citation style provided in the template.
      The bibliography must be sorted (either alphabetically when using the Name/Year citation style or
      by the order you use them in the text when numbering the sources).
  - Do not use more than two references that are websites only. If you have to cite a website use the recommended style from
    the exercise slides.


- All **symbols in equations** need to be **explained** in the text.
- All **equations, figures and tables**, if applicable, have to be **numbered and referenced** in the text.
  - All your figures should look professional.
  They should not be blurry or hand-drawn and images should not have a window border of ImageJ.
  They should not overlap with the text.
  - All figures need to have **captions** giving a brief description what the figure shows. The caption should be below the figure.
  - Label all axes in all plots and coordinate systems!
  - A list of figures is not needed.
  - Replace the images in the report template with images from your own implementation applied to knee data.


- **Do not use abbreviations without introducing them**. E.g., the first time you should write "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)".
After that, "MRI" is enough.
- Just like in storytelling, connect the context of the project report, so everyone can see the flow.
- Do not use footnotes!
- Check your spelling: there shouldn't be any obvious spelling errors that can be detected by a spell checker.

To obtain all the points for the content of your report, additional to the above

- Check whether you have addressed all the questions in the task description.
- Check whether you have provided all the result figures and a detailed explanation of them.

## Guidelines for the Use of Writing Assistants

We welcome students to use writing assistants to enhance the quality of the written report. However, we would like to point out that
students are responsible for the correctness of the content, and that **scientific references** are mandatory to verify all the claims made in the report.

If you decide to use any writing assistant, we ask you to add the tool to the list of references.
The use of spell-checking and translation software is encouraged and can be done without adding them to the list of references.
