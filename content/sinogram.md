Now you should be able to generate sinogram from volume slice.
Generate two sinograms from two volume slices:

- One sinogram from a simple test image. You can use for instance a white circle as I was doing in the last section.
- One sinogram from a real CT reconstruction. You should cite the source of that image.

Show both the volume slices and the sinograms.
Explain to the reader what they are seeing.
Do the sinograms contain some kind of symmetry? What is the reason for that.

<!--How can the Fourier-Slice-Theorem be used to reconstruct.-->
<!--Remember to explain the meaning of all variables if you should be using formulas.-->

This section should not be longer than one page.
