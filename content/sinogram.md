# Sinogram

![sinogram](../sinogram.png)

Now you should be able to generate sinogram from volume slice.
Generate two sinograms from two volume slices:

- One sinogram from a *simple test image*. You can use for instance a white circle as I was doing in the last section.
- One sinogram from a real *CT reconstruction*. You should cite the source of that image. The Cancer Imaging Archive even
[explains you how to do that](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/RIDER+Lung+CT#871e8e71d08d428c887407cfe6cb0cec).

- Show both the volume slices and the sinograms.
Explain to the reader what they are seeing. What is the radon transform?
Can the radon transform be inverted?
- Do the sinograms contain some kind of symmetry? What is the reason for that.
Do we really need a 360° degree scan?

<!--How can the Fourier-Slice-Theorem be used to reconstruct.-->
<!--Remember to explain the meaning of all variables if you should be using formulas.-->

This section should not be longer than one page.
