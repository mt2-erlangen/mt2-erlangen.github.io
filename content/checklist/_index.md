We've collected a small checklist for things that you might forget when writing your project work.
For a detailed description on how to write the report, refer to the exercise slides.
The project report can be in English or German.

To achieve full 10 points for writing style...

- Use the **templates** we provide to you. Do not modify the style or the formatting. No ornaments for page numbers!
- Use **scientific references** to prove your explanantions and to clearly separate your work from the work of others.
- Do not use more than two references that are **websites** only. If you have to cite a website use the recommended style from
the exercise slides.
- Create a **bibliography**. Follow the advises from the exercise slides.
The bibliography must be sorted (either alphabetically when using the Name/Year citation style or
by the order you use them in the text when numbering the sources).
Use the same citation style for all your references.
- Do **not use footnotes**!
- Check your **spelling**: there shouldn't be any obvious spelling errors that can be detected by Word.
- All **symbols in equations** should be explained in the text.
- All **equations, figures and tables** (tables probably not needed) should be **numbered and referenced** in the text.
- All figures should have **captions** giving a brief description what the figure shows. The caption should be below the figure.
- All **figures should be full-width**, not next text. A figure can contain multiple images next to each other.
- A list of figures is not needed.
- Do not use **abbreviation** without introducing them. The first time you should write *computer tomography (CT)*.
After that, *CT* is enough.
- **Label all axes** in all plots and coordinate systems!
- Never use "Ich" or "I". In English texts it's acceptable to use "we" even though you did all the work alone.


To obtain all the points for the content of your report

- Check whether you have addressed all the **questions** in the task description.
- Check for **numbers in the questions**. Do you really have **two** advantages and **two** disadvanges of using computer tomography?
