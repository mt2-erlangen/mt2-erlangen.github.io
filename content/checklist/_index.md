# General Information

The deadline for the project report is on August 21<sup>st</sup>.\
The project report, as well as the coding, are individual work. As such, you need to submit them individually.
Note: we'll check for plagiarism.

# Guidelines

The project report can be written in either English or German. Please write between 4 and 6 pages of text, not counting the images.


We expect you to:

- Use the **LaTeX template** we provide
  - [LaTeX template link](https://github.com/mt2-erlangen/latex-template)
  - Do not modify the style or the formatting. No ornaments for page numbers!
  - The template defines the overall structure of your project. You have to fill in all the gaps.
  - You can rewrite titles and sentences of the document but you are not allowed to change the structure (e.g. you may write 'As seen in Figure ...' instead of 'In Figures ...' if it fits). **Don't modify the location of intormation**


- Use **scientific references** in your explanations to clearly separate your work from the work of others:
  - Create a **bibliography**, using the citation style provided in the template.
      The bibliography must be sorted (either alphabetically when using the Name/Year citation style or
      by the order you use them in the text when numbering the sources).
  - Do not use more than two references that are websites only. If you have to cite a website use the recommended style from
    the exercise slides.


- All **symbols in equations** need to be **explained** in the text.
- All **equations, figures and tables**, if applicable, have to be **numbered and referenced** in the text.
  - All your figures should look professional.
  They should not be blurry or hand-drawn and images should not have a window border of ImageJ.
  They should not overlap with the text.
  - All figures need to have **captions** giving a brief description what the figure shows. The caption should be below the figure.
  - Label all axes in all plots and coordinate systems!
  - A list of figures is not needed.


- **Do not use abbreviations without introducing them**. E.g., the first time you should write "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)".
After that, "MRI" is enough.
- Just like in storytelling, connect the context of the project report, so everyone can see the flow.
- Do not use footnotes!
- Check your spelling: there shouldn't be any obvious spelling errors that can be detected by a spell checker.

To obtain all the points for the content of your report, additional to the above

- Check whether you have addressed all the questions in the task description.
- Check whether you have provided all the result figures and a detailed explanation of them.
