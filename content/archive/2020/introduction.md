# Introduction

During this semester we will learn how computer tomography (CT) reconstruction algorithms work.
Your first task is to find out more about CT and write an introduction for your project report.

- Find an **informative title** for your project report. "Project Report" and "Introduction" are not good titles.
- **What is computer tomography**?
  What is the problem it tries to solve? When and how was it first introduced?
  What kind of electromagnetic radition is used to aquire the images?
  How did modern CT devices improve over their predecessors? What is the typical spatial resolution of a state-of-the-art CT scanner?
- What are **advantages and disadvantages** of CT in comparison with other modalities. Include at least two advatages and
  two disadvantages.
- Give a **short overview** of the contents of the following sections of your project report.
- Proof all your statements with **references**. You should use at least four distinct sources in your introduction that are
  not webpages.


The introduction should not be longer than one page and but at least half a page. 


Your introduction and conclusion should not contain any images.

Please have a look on our [checklist for a good project report](../checklist).
<!--Whenever we refer to the maximum length of a section we're not counting figures and tables and just consider the length-->
<!--of the text.-->
