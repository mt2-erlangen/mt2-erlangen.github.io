# Introduction

During this semester we will learn the basic of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and how we can use post-processing methods on these images.
We will focus on the post-processing method called segmentation and will take a look on how to evaluate our method.

- Find an **informative title** for your project report. "Project Report" and "Introduction" are not good titles.
- **What is magnetic resonance imaging**?
  When and from whom was it introduced? What kind of electromagnetic radiation is used to acquire the images? How does the radiation interact with the patients body? 
- What are **advantages and disadvantages** of MRI in comparisson with Computer Tomography(CT). Include at least two advantages and
  two disadvantages.
- Give a **short overview** of the contents of the following sections of your project report.
- Proof all your statements with **references**. You should use at least four distinct sources in your introduction that are
  not webpages.


The introduction should not be longer than one page and but at least half a page. 


Your introduction and conclusion should not contain any images.

Please have a look on our [checklist for a good project report](../checklist).
<!--Whenever we refer to the maximum length of a section we're not counting figures and tables and just consider the length-->
