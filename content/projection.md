# Projections

To understand how we can reconstruct volume from X-ray images, we will first go through the process how these X-ray images
were acquired from the physical volume.

In your project report you should...

- explain the reader the physical process of **X-ray attenuation** and how this process is material dependent
- explain the **fundamental theorem** describes this process. Give a formula!
- prove your explanations with references, also provide the source of the formula

In this project work, we will make some simplifying assumptions on the acquisition geometry.
Look I made a nice little drawing!


Unfortunally, there seems to be some coffee spills, some information is missing on it and
you shouldn't use hand drawn figures.
Create a better figure for your project report with everything labeled.
Do some math to give equations for the points on the lines.

- How does the described situation differ from the **actual acquisition geometry** of modern CT scanners?
  What are the reasons for that? Could our simplified situation be implemented in reality?
- **After Implementation:** what would you need to change in your implementation to cover the real geometry?
- **After Implementation:** what physical effects were neglected in our simulation but are present in reality?
    Name at least three non-idealities of real systems.

This part of the project work should be not longer than 1.5 pages.
